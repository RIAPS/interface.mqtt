broker_connect_config:
  host: ctrl  # the hostname or IP address of the remote broker
  port: 1883  # the network port of the server host to connect to. Defaults to 1883. Note that the default port for MQTT over SSL/TLS is 8883 so if you are using tls_set() or tls_set_context(), the port may need providing manually
  keepalive: 60  # maximum period in seconds allowed between communications with the broker. If no other messages are being exchanged, this controls the rate at which the client will send ping messages to the broker
  bind_address: ""  # the IP address of a local network interface to bind this client to, assuming multiple interfaces exist
